# Home Network Setup

In this project, I will be setting up a small network at my home using Cisco primarily Cisco hardware. I plan on setting up basic configurations, VLANs, IP routing, router-on-a-stick, ACLs, among other common network configurations.

## Initial Planning

Here, I will be creating my initial plan for my network. This primarily consists of creating an addressing table and configuring it in a packet tracer simulation to verify that it will work before implementing any changes.

### 

This Cisco network consists of a single switch, a router configured using the router-on-a-stick method, and 2 end devices connect to the switch. The switch has two VLANs with 4 access ports assigned to each and a trunk port connecting to the router. The router is configured with sub-interfaces for each VLAN, allowing inter-VLAN communication through a single physical link. Basic configurations such as hostnames, console passwords, and service password encryption are also applied to enhance network management and security.
