# Home Network Setup

In this project, I will be setting up a small network at my home using Cisco primarily Cisco hardware. I plan on setting up basic configurations, VLANs, IP routing, router-on-a-stick, ACLs, among other common network configurations.

## Initial Planning

Here, I will be creating my initial plan for my network. This primarily consists of creating an addressing table and configuring it in a packet tracer simulation to verify that it will work before implementing any changes.
